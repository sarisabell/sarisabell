- 👋 Hi, I’m @sarisabell
- 👀 I’m interested in anything related to Water Treatment and Sensors, Digitalization and ML in Water Sciences (Water chemistry, Treatment Prediction ...)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to apply some code to easier handle my work and finding better way to possibly apply ML to predict water qualities or similar.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the work related to the above mentioned topics. :)
